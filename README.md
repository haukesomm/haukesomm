I'm a professional full-stack software engineer from the center of Hamburg, Germany. Currently, I'm mainly focusing on both web back- and front-end development. I am also a strong advocate of free and open-source software.

Personally, I like to explore new places both in my local neighborhood and abroad, take care of my plants or play some games on my Nintendo Switch.
Furthermore, I'm interested in sustainable and people-friendly urban development.
