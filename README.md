I'm a professional full-stack software engineer based in the heart of Hamburg, Germany. Currently, I'm focusing on both back-end and front-end web development. Additionally, I'm a dedicated advocate for free and open-source software, as well as an open web.

In my personal life, I enjoy exploring new places, both locally and abroad, taking care of my plants, and playing games on my Nintendo Switch. Also, I'm interested in sustainable and community-focused urban development.
