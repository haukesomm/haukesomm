I'm a professional full-stack software engineer based in the heart of Hamburg, Germany. Focusing on web technologies, 
I am passionate about building high-quality software that is easy to maintain and fun to use. Additionally, I'm a 
dedicated advocate for free and open-source software, as well as an open web.

In my personal life, I enjoy exploring new places, both locally and abroad, taking care of my plants, and playing games 
on my Nintendo Switch. Also, I'm interested in sustainable and community-focused urban development.
